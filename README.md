# Multiple Stopwatches

## Summary

This tool allows you to create, name, export and bind a key to multiple stopwatches. Pressing the keybind will toggle between starting and stopping. You can also create a "macro", which is a single keyboard shortcut that starts and stops multiple stopwatches at once.
